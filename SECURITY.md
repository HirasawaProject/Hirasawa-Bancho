# Security Policy

We would like to take security very seriously, while we don't have a huge budget we'd like to reward honest work, so I'm
willing to give Â£5 for each reported issue that fits within our guidelines

## What we're interested in
* Remote code execution (includes SQL injections)
* Denial of service exploits (not including basic high traffic attacks)
* Failures in encryption (passwords, SSL, etc)
* Remote retrieval of secrets (any data clients shouldn't have their hands on, e.g. passwords, system info, etc)
* Web request forgery

## Rules
Because now there's money involved (albeit fairly low) there are some restrictions we'd like to put in place
* Must be the first time reporting issue
* Must not be a bug you caused yourself
* The PoC exploit needs to work against the master branch at the time of claim
* Max 5 rewards per person
* Bugs must be exploitable with a base install of Hirasawa, rouge plugins will not count
* Only do security testing against your own local instance of Hirasawa 

## How to report
In order to report a security issues please either contact me (Connor) on our official Discord or emailing 
security@hirasawa.io, do not report this issue on the public issue tracker

## Timeframe

respond.
