# Hirasawa Project
Hirasawa Project is a WIP server for osu! supporting custom plugins written in Kotlin

## Plugins
We will be supporting plugins to extend the functionality of the server in a similar way to how Bukkit handles it for
Minecraft utilising events for all actions in-game

We will also have a plugin store available at some point later down the line of development

## Contribution
Please wait while I get the bulk of the system frame done first and then I can outline how you can help with development

## Licencing
Hirasawa Project is licenced under the MIT licence so do with it as you please
