# Hirasawa Project
Hirasawa Project is a WIP server for osu! supporting custom plugins written in Kotlin

## Plugins
We will be supporting plugins to extend the functionality of the server in a similar way to how Bukkit handles it for
Minecraft utilising events for all actions in-game

We will also have a plugin store available at some point later down the line of development

## Requirements
* Java 8
* Mysql (soon to be configurable)
* Gradle

In terms of hardware requirements I've gotten this to run on a Pi Zero

## Building
Building Hirasawa is very easy, all you need to do is run
`gradle build` and the jar will be built under `build/libs/HirasawaProjectXXXX.jar`

## Contribution
Please wait while I get the bulk of the system frame done first and then I can outline how you can help with development

## Licencing
Hirasawa Project is licenced under the MIT licence so do with it as you please
